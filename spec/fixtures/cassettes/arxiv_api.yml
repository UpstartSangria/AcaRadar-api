            <title>Queue-Aware Distributive Resource Control for Delay-Sensitive Two-Hop
          MIMO Cooperative Systems</title>
            <summary>  In this paper, we consider a queue-aware distributive resource control
        algorithm for two-hop MIMO cooperative systems. We shall illustrate that relay
        buffering is an effective way to reduce the intrinsic half-duplex penalty in
        cooperative systems. The complex interactions of the queues at the source node
        and the relays are modeled as an average-cost infinite horizon Markov Decision
        Process (MDP). The traditional approach solving this MDP problem involves
        centralized control with huge complexity. To obtain a distributive and low
        complexity solution, we introduce a linear structure which approximates the
        value function of the associated Bellman equation by the sum of per-node value
        functions. We derive a distributive two-stage two-winner auction-based control
        policy which is a function of the local CSI and local QSI only. Furthermore, to
        estimate the best fit approximation parameter, we propose a distributive online
        stochastic learning algorithm using stochastic approximation theory. Finally,
        we establish technical conditions for almost-sure convergence and show that
        under heavy traffic, the proposed low complexity distributive control is global
        optimal.

            <title>Successive normalization of rectangular arrays</title>
            <summary>  Standard statistical techniques often require transforming data to have mean
        $0$ and standard deviation $1$. Typically, this process of "standardization" or
        "normalization" is applied across subjects when each subject produces a single
        number. High throughput genomic and financial data often come as rectangular
        arrays where each coordinate in one direction concerns subjects who might have
        different status (case or control, say), and each coordinate in the other
        designates "outcome" for a specific feature, for example, "gene," "polymorphic
        site" or some aspect of financial profile. It may happen, when analyzing data
        that arrive as a rectangular array, that one requires BOTH the subjects and the
        features to be "on the same footing." Thus there may be a need to standardize
        across rows and columns of the rectangular matrix. There arises the question as
        to how to achieve this double normalization. We propose and investigate the
        convergence of what seems to us a natural approach to successive normalization
        which we learned from our colleague Bradley Efron. We also study the
        implementation of the method on simulated data and also on data that arose from
        scientific experimentation.

            <title>Asymptotic Normality of Support Vector Machine Variants and Other
          Regularized Kernel Methods</title>
            <summary>  In nonparametric classification and regression problems, regularized kernel
        methods, in particular support vector machines, attract much attention in
        theoretical and in applied statistics. In an abstract sense, regularized kernel
        methods (simply called SVMs here) can be seen as regularized M-estimators for a
        parameter in a (typically infinite dimensional) reproducing kernel Hilbert
        space. For smooth loss functions, it is shown that the difference between the
        estimator, i.e.\ the empirical SVM, and the theoretical SVM is asymptotically
        normal with rate $\sqrt{n}$. That is, the standardized difference converges
        weakly to a Gaussian process in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. As common
        in real applications, the choice of the regularization parameter may depend on
        the data. The proof is done by an application of the functional delta-method
        and by showing that the SVM-functional is suitably Hadamard-differentiable.

            <title>Regularizers for Structured Sparsity</title>
            <summary>  We study the problem of learning a sparse linear regression vector under
        additional conditions on the structure of its sparsity pattern. This problem is
        relevant in machine learning, statistics and signal processing. It is well
        known that a linear regression can benefit from knowledge that the underlying
        regression vector is sparse. The combinatorial problem of selecting the nonzero
        components of this vector can be "relaxed" by regularizing the squared error
        with a convex penalty function like the $\ell_1$ norm. However, in many
        applications, additional conditions on the structure of the regression vector
        and its sparsity pattern are available. Incorporating this information into the
        learning method may lead to a significant decrease of the estimation error. In
        this paper, we present a family of convex penalty functions, which encode prior
        knowledge on the structure of the vector formed by the absolute values of the
        regression coefficients. This family subsumes the $\ell_1$ norm and is flexible
        enough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical
        and theoretical importance. We establish the basic properties of these penalty
        functions and discuss some examples where they can be computed explicitly.
        Moreover, we present a convergent optimization algorithm for solving
        regularized least squares with these penalty functions. Numerical simulations
        highlight the benefit of structured sparsity and the advantage offered by our
        approach over the Lasso method and other related methods.

            <title>Selfish Response to Epidemic Propagation</title>
            <summary>  An epidemic spreading in a network calls for a decision on the part of the
        network members: They should decide whether to protect themselves or not. Their
        decision depends on the trade-off between their perceived risk of being
        infected and the cost of being protected. The network members can make
        decisions repeatedly, based on information that they receive about the changing
        infection level in the network.
          We study the equilibrium states reached by a network whose members increase
        (resp. decrease) their security deployment when learning that the network
        infection is widespread (resp. limited). Our main finding is that the
        equilibrium level of infection increases as the learning rate of the members
        increases. We confirm this result in three scenarios for the behavior of the
        members: strictly rational cost minimizers, not strictly rational, and strictly
        rational but split into two response classes. In the first two cases, we
        completely characterize the stability and the domains of attraction of the
        equilibrium points, even though the first case leads to a differential
        inclusion. We validate our conclusions with simulations on human mobility
        traces.

            <title>Local Optimality of User Choices and Collaborative Competitive Filtering</title>
            <summary>  While a user's preference is directly reflected in the interactive choice
        process between her and the recommender, this wealth of information was not
        fully exploited for learning recommender models. In particular, existing
        collaborative filtering (CF) approaches take into account only the binary
        events of user actions but totally disregard the contexts in which users'
        decisions are made. In this paper, we propose Collaborative Competitive
        Filtering (CCF), a framework for learning user preferences by modeling the
        choice process in recommender systems. CCF employs a multiplicative latent
        factor model to characterize the dyadic utility function. But unlike CF, CCF
        models the user behavior of choices by encoding a local competition effect. In
        this way, CCF allows us to leverage dyadic data that was previously lumped
        together with missing data in existing CF models. We present two formulations
        and an efficient large scale optimization algorithm. Experiments on three
        real-world recommendation data sets demonstrate that CCF significantly
        outperforms standard CF approaches in both offline and online evaluations.

            <title>Implementing regularization implicitly via approximate eigenvector
          computation</title>
            <summary>  Regularization is a powerful technique for extracting useful information from
        noisy data. Typically, it is implemented by adding some sort of norm constraint
        to an objective function and then exactly optimizing the modified objective
        function. This procedure often leads to optimization problems that are
        computationally more expensive than the original problem, a fact that is
        clearly problematic if one is interested in large-scale applications. On the
        other hand, a large body of empirical work has demonstrated that heuristics,
        and in some cases approximation algorithms, developed to speed up computations
        sometimes have the side-effect of performing regularization implicitly. Thus,
        we consider the question: What is the regularized optimization objective that
        an approximation algorithm is exactly optimizing?
          We address this question in the context of computing approximations to the
        smallest nontrivial eigenvector of a graph Laplacian; and we consider three
        random-walk-based procedures: one based on the heat kernel of the graph, one
        based on computing the the PageRank vector associated with the graph, and one
        based on a truncated lazy random walk. In each case, we provide a precise
        characterization of the manner in which the approximation method can be viewed
        as implicitly computing the exact solution to a regularized problem.
        Interestingly, the regularization is not on the usual vector form of the
        optimization problem, but instead it is on a related semidefinite program.

            <title>A bagging SVM to learn from positive and unlabeled examples</title>
            <summary>  We consider the problem of learning a binary classifier from a training set
        of positive and unlabeled examples, both in the inductive and in the
        transductive setting. This problem, often referred to as \emph{PU learning},
        differs from the standard supervised classification problem by the lack of
        negative examples in the training set. It corresponds to an ubiquitous
        situation in many applications such as information retrieval or gene ranking,
        when we have identified a set of data of interest sharing a particular
        property, and we wish to automatically retrieve additional data sharing the
        same property among a large and easily available pool of unlabeled data. We
        propose a conceptually simple method, akin to bagging, to approach both
        inductive and transductive PU learning problems, by converting them into series
        of supervised binary classification problems discriminating the known positive
        examples from random subsamples of the unlabeled set. We empirically
        demonstrate the relevance of the method on simulated and real data, where it
        performs at least as well as existing methods while being faster.

            <title>Estimation of low-rank tensors via convex optimization</title>
            <summary>  In this paper, we propose three approaches for the estimation of the Tucker
        decomposition of multi-way arrays (tensors) from partial observations. All
        approaches are formulated as convex minimization problems. Therefore, the
        minimum is guaranteed to be unique. The proposed approaches can automatically
        estimate the number of factors (rank) through the optimization. Thus, there is
        no need to specify the rank beforehand. The key technique we employ is the
        trace norm regularization, which is a popular approach for the estimation of
        low-rank matrices. In addition, we propose a simple heuristic to improve the
        interpretability of the obtained factorization. The advantages and
        disadvantages of three proposed approaches are demonstrated through numerical
        experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets. We show that the
        proposed convex optimization based approaches are more accurate in predictive
        performance, faster, and more reliable in recovering a known multilinear
        structure than conventional approaches.

            <title>Hidden Markov Models with Multiple Observation Processes</title>
            <summary>  We consider a hidden Markov model with multiple observation processes, one of
        which is chosen at each point in time by a policy---a deterministic function of
        the information state---and attempt to determine which policy minimises the
        limiting expected entropy of the information state. Focusing on a special case,
        we prove analytically that the information state always converges in
        distribution, and derive a formula for the limiting entropy which can be used
        for calculations with high precision. Using this fomula, we find
        computationally that the optimal policy is always a threshold policy, allowing
        it to be easily found. We also find that the greedy policy is almost optimal.

            <title>A sparse regulatory network of copy-number driven expression reveals
          putative breast cancer oncogenes</title>
            <summary>  The influence of DNA cis-regulatory elements on a gene's expression has been
        intensively studied. However, little is known about expressions driven by
        trans-acting DNA hotspots. DNA hotspots harboring copy number aberrations are
        recognized to be important in cancer as they influence multiple genes on a
        global scale. The challenge in detecting trans-effects is mainly due to the
        computational difficulty in detecting weak and sparse trans-acting signals
        amidst co-occuring passenger events. We propose an integrative approach to
        learn a sparse interaction network of DNA copy-number regions with their
        downstream targets in a breast cancer dataset. Information from this network
        helps distinguish copy-number driven from copy-number independent expression
        changes on a global scale. Our result further delineates cis- and trans-effects
        in a breast cancer dataset, for which important oncogenes such as ESR1 and
        ERBB2 appear to be highly copy-number dependent. Further, our model is shown to
        be efficient and in terms of goodness of fit no worse than other state-of the
        art predictors and network reconstruction models using both simulated and real
        data.

            <title>Mixed-Membership Stochastic Block-Models for Transactional Networks</title>
            <summary>  Transactional network data can be thought of as a list of one-to-many
        communications(e.g., email) between nodes in a social network. Most social
        network models convert this type of data into binary relations between pairs of
        nodes. We develop a latent mixed membership model capable of modeling richer
        forms of transactional network data, including relations between more than two
        nodes. The model can cluster nodes and predict transactions. The block-model
        nature of the model implies that groups can be characterized in very general
        ways. This flexible notion of group structure enables discovery of rich
        structure in transactional networks. Estimation and inference are accomplished
        via a variational EM algorithm. Simulations indicate that the learning
        algorithm can recover the correct generative model. Interesting structure is
        discovered in the Enron email dataset and another dataset extracted from the
        Reddit website. Analysis of the Reddit data is facilitated by a novel
        performance measure for comparing two soft clusterings. The new model is
        superior at discovering mixed membership in groups and in predicting
        transactions.

            <title>Completely Stale Transmitter Channel State Information is Still Very
          Useful</title>
            <summary>  Transmitter channel state information (CSIT) is crucial for the multiplexing
        gains offered by advanced interference management techniques such as multiuser
        MIMO and interference alignment. Such CSIT is usually obtained by feedback from
        the receivers, but the feedback is subject to delays. The usual approach is to
        use the fed back information to predict the current channel state and then
        apply a scheme designed assuming perfect CSIT. When the feedback delay is large
        compared to the channel coherence time, such a prediction approach completely
        fails to achieve any multiplexing gain. In this paper, we show that even in
        this case, the completely stale CSI is still very useful. More concretely, we
        show that in a MIMO broadcast channel with $K$ transmit antennas and $K$
        receivers each with 1 receive antenna, $\frac{K}{1+1/2+ ...+ \frac{1}{K}} (&gt; 1)
        $ degrees of freedom is achievable even when the fed back channel state is
        completely independent of the current channel state. Moreover, we establish
        that if all receivers have independent and identically distributed channels,
        then this is the optimal number of degrees of freedom achievable. In the
        optimal scheme, the transmitter uses the fed back CSI to learn the side
        information that the receivers receive from previous transmissions rather than
        to predict the current channel state. Our result can be viewed as the first
        example of feedback providing a degree-of-freedom gain in memoryless channels.

            <title>Time Series Classification by Class-Specific Mahalanobis Distance
          Measures</title>
            <summary>  To classify time series by nearest neighbors, we need to specify or learn one
        or several distance measures. We consider variations of the Mahalanobis
        distance measures which rely on the inverse covariance matrix of the data.
        Unfortunately --- for time series data --- the covariance matrix has often low
        rank. To alleviate this problem we can either use a pseudoinverse, covariance
        shrinking or limit the matrix to its diagonal. We review these alternatives and
        benchmark them against competitive methods such as the related Large Margin
        Nearest Neighbor Classification (LMNN) and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
        distance. As we expected, we find that the DTW is superior, but the Mahalanobis
        distance measures are one to two orders of magnitude faster. To get best
        results with Mahalanobis distance measures, we recommend learning one distance
        measure per class using either covariance shrinking or the diagonal approach.

            <title>Algorithmic and Statistical Perspectives on Large-Scale Data Analysis</title>
            <summary>  In recent years, ideas from statistics and scientific computing have begun to
        interact in increasingly sophisticated and fruitful ways with ideas from
        computer science and the theory of algorithms to aid in the development of
        improved worst-case algorithms that are useful for large-scale scientific and
        Internet data analysis problems. In this chapter, I will describe two recent
        examples---one having to do with selecting good columns or features from a (DNA
        Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) data matrix, and the other having to do with
        selecting good clusters or communities from a data graph (representing a social
        or information network)---that drew on ideas from both areas and that may serve
        as a model for exploiting complementary algorithmic and statistical
        perspectives in order to solve applied large-scale data analysis problems.

            <title>Algorithms for nonnegative matrix factorization with the beta-divergence</title>
            <summary>  This paper describes algorithms for nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)
        with the beta-divergence (beta-NMF). The beta-divergence is a family of cost
        functions parametrized by a single shape parameter beta that takes the
        Euclidean distance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Itakura-Saito
        divergence as special cases (beta = 2,1,0, respectively). The proposed
        algorithms are based on a surrogate auxiliary function (a local majorization of
        the criterion function). We first describe a majorization-minimization (MM)
        algorithm that leads to multiplicative updates, which differ from standard
        heuristic multiplicative updates by a beta-dependent power exponent. The
        monotonicity of the heuristic algorithm can however be proven for beta in (0,1)
        using the proposed auxiliary function. Then we introduce the concept of
        majorization-equalization (ME) algorithm which produces updates that move along
        constant level sets of the auxiliary function and lead to larger steps than MM.
        Simulations on synthetic and real data illustrate the faster convergence of the
        ME approach. The paper also describes how the proposed algorithms can be
        adapted to two common variants of NMF : penalized NMF (i.e., when a penalty
        function of the factors is added to the criterion function) and convex-NMF
        (when the dictionary is assumed to belong to a known subspace).

            <title>Infinite Hierarchical MMSB Model for Nested Communities/Groups in Social
          Networks</title>
            <summary>  Actors in realistic social networks play not one but a number of diverse
        roles depending on whom they interact with, and a large number of such
        role-specific interactions collectively determine social communities and their
        organizations. Methods for analyzing social networks should capture these
        multi-faceted role-specific interactions, and, more interestingly, discover the
        latent organization or hierarchy of social communities. We propose a
        hierarchical Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodel to model the generation of
        hierarchies in social communities, selective membership of actors to subsets of
        these communities, and the resultant networks due to within- and
        cross-community interactions. Furthermore, to automatically discover these
        latent structures from social networks, we develop a Gibbs sampling algorithm
        for our model. We conduct extensive validation of our model using synthetic
        networks, and demonstrate the utility of our model in real-world datasets such
        as predator-prey networks and citation networks.

            <title>Multi-Objective Genetic Programming Projection Pursuit for Exploratory
          Data Modeling</title>
            <summary>  For classification problems, feature extraction is a crucial process which
        aims to find a suitable data representation that increases the performance of
        the machine learning algorithm. According to the curse of dimensionality
        theorem, the number of samples needed for a classification task increases
        exponentially as the number of dimensions (variables, features) increases. On
        the other hand, it is costly to collect, store and process data. Moreover,
        irrelevant and redundant features might hinder classifier performance. In
        exploratory analysis settings, high dimensionality prevents the users from
        exploring the data visually. Feature extraction is a two-step process: feature
        construction and feature selection. Feature construction creates new features
        based on the original features and feature selection is the process of
        selecting the best features as in filter, wrapper and embedded methods.
          In this work, we focus on feature construction methods that aim to decrease
        data dimensionality for visualization tasks. Various linear (such as principal
        components analysis (PCA), multiple discriminants analysis (MDA), exploratory
        projection pursuit) and non-linear (such as multidimensional scaling (MDS),
        manifold learning, kernel PCA/LDA, evolutionary constructive induction)
        techniques have been proposed for dimensionality reduction. Our algorithm is an
        adaptive feature extraction method which consists of evolutionary constructive
        induction for feature construction and a hybrid filter/wrapper method for
        feature selection.

            <title>Hierarchical Multiclass Decompositions with Application to Authorship
          Determination</title>
            <summary>  This paper is mainly concerned with the question of how to decompose
        multiclass classification problems into binary subproblems. We extend known
        Jensen-Shannon bounds on the Bayes risk of binary problems to hierarchical
        multiclass problems and use these bounds to develop a heuristic procedure for
        constructing hierarchical multiclass decomposition for multinomials. We test
        our method and compare it to the well known "all-pairs" decomposition. Our
        tests are performed using a new authorship determination benchmark test of
        machine learning authors. The new method consistently outperforms the all-pairs
        decomposition when the number of classes is small and breaks even on larger
        multiclass problems. Using both methods, the classification accuracy we
        achieve, using an SVM over a feature set consisting of both high frequency
        single tokens and high frequency token-pairs, appears to be exceptionally high
        compared to known results in authorship determination.

            <title>Combiner suivi de l'activite? et partage d'expériences en
          apprentissage par projet pour les acteurs tuteurs et apprenants</title>
            <summary>  Our work aims to study tools offered to students and tutors involved in
        face-to-face or blended project- based learning activities. Project-based
        learning is often applied in the case of complex learning (i.e. which aims at
        making learners acquire various linked skills or develop their behaviours). In
        comparison to traditional learning, this type of learning relies on
        co-development, collective responsibility and co-operation. Learners are the
        principal actors of their learning. These trainings rest on rich and complex
        organizations, particularly for tutors, and it is difficult to apply innovative
        educational strategies. Our aim, in a bottom-up approach, is (1) to observe,
        according to Knowledge Management methods, a course characterized by these
        three criteria. The observed course concerns project management learning. Its
        observation allows us (2) to highlight and to analyze the problems encountered
        by the actors (students, tutors, designers) and (3) to propose tools to solve
        or improve them. We particularly study the relevance and the limits of the
        existing monitoring and experience sharing tools. We finally propose a result
        in the form of the tool MEShaT (Monitoring and Experience Sharing Tool) and end
        on the perspectives offered by these researches.

            <title>Modeling the scaling properties of human mobility</title>
            <summary>  While the fat tailed jump size and the waiting time distributions
        characterizing individual human trajectories strongly suggest the relevance of
        the continuous time random walk (CTRW) models of human mobility, no one
        seriously believes that human traces are truly random. Given the importance of
        human mobility, from epidemic modeling to traffic prediction and urban
        planning, we need quantitative models that can account for the statistical
        characteristics of individual human trajectories. Here we use empirical data on
        human mobility, captured by mobile phone traces, to show that the predictions
        of the CTRW models are in systematic conflict with the empirical results. We
        introduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a
        statistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility.
        The model not only accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws but also
        allows us to analytically predict most of the pertinent scaling exponents.

            <title>Approximating Mexican highways with slime mould</title>
            <summary>  Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a single cell visible by unaided eye.
        During its foraging behavior the cell spans spatially distributed sources of
        nutrients with a protoplasmic network. Geometrical structure of the
        protoplasmic networks allows the plasmodium to optimize transport of nutrients
        between remote parts of its body. Assuming major Mexican cities are sources of
        nutrients how much structure of Physarum protoplasmic network correspond to
        structure of Mexican Federal highway network? To find an answer undertook a
        series of laboratory experiments with living Physarum polycephalum. We
        represent geographical locations of major cities by oat flakes, place a piece
        of plasmodium in Mexico city area, record the plasmodium's foraging behavior
        and extract topology of nutrient transport networks. Results of our experiments
        show that the protoplasmic network formed by Physarum is isomorphic, subject to
        limitations imposed, to a network of principle highways. Ideas and results of
        the paper may contribute towards future developments in bio-inspired road
        planning.

            <title>Creation and control of a two-dimensional electron liquid at the bare
          SrTiO3 surface</title>
            <summary>  Many-body interactions in transition-metal oxides give rise to a wide range
        of functional properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, colossal
        magnetoresistance, or multiferroicity. The seminal recent discovery of a
        two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of the insulating oxides
        LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 represents an important milestone towards exploiting such
        properties in all-oxide devices. This conducting interface shows a number of
        appealing properties, including a high electron mobility, superconductivity,
        and large magnetoresistance and can be patterned on the few-nanometer length
        scale. However, the microscopic origin of the interface 2DEG is poorly
        understood. Here, we show that a similar 2DEG, with an electron density as
        large as 8x10^13 cm^-2, can be formed at the bare SrTiO3 surface. Furthermore,
        we find that the 2DEG density can be controlled through exposure of the surface
        to intense ultraviolet (UV) light. Subsequent angle-resolved photoemission
        spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal an unusual coexistence of a light
        quasiparticle mass and signatures of strong many-body interactions.

            <title>Quantum gravitational contributions to quantum electrodynamics</title>
            <summary>  Quantum electrodynamics describes the interactions of electrons and photons.
        Electric charge (the gauge coupling constant) is energy dependent, and there is
        a previous claim that charge is affected by gravity (described by general
        relativity) with the implication that the charge is reduced at high energies.
        But that claim has been very controversial with the situation inconclusive.
        Here I report an analysis (free from earlier controversies) demonstrating that
        that quantum gravity corrections to quantum electrodynamics have a quadratic
        energy dependence that result in the reduction of the electric charge at high
        energies, a result known as asymptotic freedom.

            <title>Quantum networks reveal quantum nonlocality</title>
            <summary>  The results of local measurements on some composite quantum systems cannot be
        reproduced classically. This impossibility, known as quantum nonlocality,
        represents a milestone in the foundations of quantum theory. Quantum
        nonlocality is also a valuable resource for information processing tasks, e.g.
        quantum communication, quantum key distribution, quantum state estimation, or
        randomness extraction. Still, deciding if a quantum state is nonlocal remains a
        challenging problem. Here we introduce a novel approach to this question: we
        study the nonlocal properties of quantum states when distributed and measured
        in networks. Using our framework, we show how any one-way entanglement
        distillable state leads to nonlocal correlations. Then, we prove that
        nonlocality is a non-additive resource, which can be activated. There exist
        states, local at the single-copy level, that become nonlocal when taking
        several copies of it. Our results imply that the nonlocality of quantum states
        strongly depends on the measurement context.

            <title>High star formation rates as the origin of turbulence in early and
          modern disk galaxies</title>
            <summary>  High spatial and spectral resolution observations of star formation and
        kinematics in early galaxies have shown that two-thirds are massive rotating
        disk galaxies with the remainder being less massive non-rotating objects. The
        line of sight averaged velocity dispersions are typically five times higher
        than in today's disk galaxies. This has suggested that
        gravitationally-unstable, gas-rich disks in the early Universe are fuelled by
        cold, dense accreting gas flowing along cosmic filaments and penetrating hot
        galactic gas halos. However these accreting flows have not been observed, and
        cosmic accretion cannot power the observed level of turbulence. Here we report
        on a new sample of rare high-velocity-dispersion disk galaxies we have
        discovered in the nearby Universe where cold accretion is unlikely to drive
        their high star-formation rates. We find that the velocity dispersion is most
        fundamentally correlated with their star-formation rates, and not their mass
        nor gas fraction, which leads to a new picture where star formation itself is
        the energetic driver of galaxy disk turbulence at all cosmic epochs.

            <title>Time-resolved detection of spin-transfer-driven ferromagnetic resonance
          and spin torque measurement in magnetic tunnel junctions</title>
            <summary>  Several experimental techniques have been introduced in recent years in
        attempts to measure spin transfer torque in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs).
        The dependence of spin torque on bias is important for understanding
        fundamental spin physics in magnetic devices and for applications. However,
        previous techniques have provided only indirect measures of the torque and
        their results to date for the bias dependence are qualitatively and
        quantitatively inconsistent. Here we demonstrate that spin torque in MTJs can
        be measured directly by using time-domain techniques to detect resonant
        magnetic precession in response to an oscillating spin torque. The technique is
        accurate in the high-bias regime relevant for applications, and because it
        detects directly small-angle linear-response magnetic dynamics caused by spin
        torque it is relatively immune to artifacts affecting competing techniques. At
        high bias we find that the spin torque vector differs markedly from the simple
        lowest-order Taylor series approximations commonly assumed.

            <title>Noiseless nonreciprocity in a parametric active device</title>
            <summary>  Nonreciprocal devices such as circulators and isolators belong to an
        important class of microwave components employed in applications like the
        measurement of mesoscopic circuits at cryogenic temperatures. The measurement
        protocols usually involve an amplification chain which relies on circulators to
        separate input and output channels and to suppress backaction from different
        stages on the sample under test. In these devices the usual reciprocal symmetry
        of circuits is broken by the phenomenon of Faraday rotation based on magnetic
        materials and fields. However, magnets are averse to on-chip integration, and
        magnetic fields are deleterious to delicate superconducting devices. Here we
        present a new proposal combining two stages of parametric modulation emulating
        the action of a circulator. It is devoid of magnetic components and suitable
        for on-chip integration. As the design is free of any dissipative elements and
        based on reversible operation, the device operates noiselessly, giving it an
        important advantage over other nonreciprocal active devices for quantum
        information processing applications.

            <title>Emergent complex neural dynamics</title>
            <summary>  A large repertoire of spatiotemporal activity patterns in the brain is the
        basis for adaptive behaviour. Understanding the mechanism by which the brain's
        hundred billion neurons and hundred trillion synapses manage to produce such a
        range of cortical configurations in a flexible manner remains a fundamental
        problem in neuroscience. One plausible solution is the involvement of universal
        mechanisms of emergent complex phenomena evident in dynamical systems poised
        near a critical point of a second-order phase transition. We review recent
        theoretical and empirical results supporting the notion that the brain is
        naturally poised near criticality, as well as its implications for better
        understanding of the brain.

            <title>Electric-field control of spin waves at room temperature in multiferroic
          BiFeO3</title>
            <summary>  To face the challenges lying beyond current CMOS-based technology, new
        paradigms for information processing are required. Magnonics proposes to use
        spin waves to carry and process information, in analogy with photonics that
        relies on light waves, with several advantageous features such as potential
        operation in the THz range and excellent coupling to spintronics. Several
        magnonic analog and digital logic devices have been proposed, and some
        demonstrated. Just as for spintronics, a key issue for magnonics is the large
        power required to control/write information (conventionally achieved through
        magnetic fields applied by strip lines, or by spin transfer from large
        spin-polarized currents). Here we show that in BiFeO3, a room-temperature
        magnetoelectric material, the spin wave frequency (&gt;600 GHz) can be tuned
        electrically by over 30%, in a non-volatile way and with virtually no power
        dissipation. Theoretical calculations indicate that this effect originates from
        a linear magnetoelectric effect related to spin-orbit coupling induced by the
        applied electric field. We argue that these properties make BiFeO3 a promising
        medium for spin wave generation, conversion and control in future magnonics
        architectures.

            <title>Controlling the quantum stereodynamics of ultracold bimolecular
          reactions</title>
            <summary>  Chemical reaction rates often depend strongly on stereodynamics, namely the
        orientation and movement of molecules in three-dimensional space. An ultracold
        molecular gas, with a temperature below 1 uK, provides a highly unusual regime
        for chemistry, where polar molecules can easily be oriented using an external
        electric field and where, moreover, the motion of two colliding molecules is
        strictly quantized. Recently, atom-exchange reactions were observed in a
        trapped ultracold gas of KRb molecules. In an external electric field, these
        exothermic and barrierless bimolecular reactions, KRb+KRb -&gt; K2+Rb2, occur at a
        rate that rises steeply with increasing dipole moment. Here we show that the
        quantum stereodynamics of the ultracold collisions can be exploited to suppress
        the bimolecular chemical reaction rate by nearly two orders of magnitude. We
        use an optical lattice trap to confine the fermionic polar molecules in a
        quasi-two-dimensional, pancake-like geometry, with the dipoles oriented along
        the tight confinement direction. With the combination of sufficiently tight
        confinement and Fermi statistics of the molecules, two polar molecules can
        approach each other only in a "side-by-side" collision, where the chemical
        reaction rate is suppressed by the repulsive dipole-dipole interaction. We show
        that the suppression of the bimolecular reaction rate requires quantum-state
        control of both the internal and external degrees of freedom of the molecules.
        The suppression of chemical reactions for polar molecules in a
        quasi-two-dimensional trap opens the way for investigation of a dipolar
        molecular quantum gas. Because of the strong, long-range character of the
        dipole-dipole interactions, such a gas brings fundamentally new abilities to
        quantum-gas-based studies of strongly correlated many-body physics, where
        quantum phase transitions and new states of matter can emerge.

            <title>One-by-one trap activation in silicon nanowire transistors</title>
            <summary>  Flicker or 1/f noise in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors
        (MOSFETs) has been identified as the main source of noise at low frequency. It
        often originates from an ensemble of a huge number of charges trapping and
        detrapping. However, a deviation from the well-known model of 1/f noise is
        observed for nanoscale MOSFETs and a new model is required. Here, we report the
        observation of one-by-one trap activation controlled by the gate voltage in a
        nanowire MOSFET and we propose a new low-frequency-noise theory for nanoscale
        FETs. We demonstrate that the Coulomb repulsion between electronically charged
        trap sites avoids the activation of several traps simultaneously. This effect
        induces a noise reduction by more than one order of magnitude. It decreases
        when increasing the electron density in the channel due to the electrical
        screening of traps. These findings are technologically useful for any FETs with
        a short and narrow channel.

            <title>Imaging Coulomb Islands in a Quantum Hall Interferometer</title>
            <summary>  In the Quantum Hall regime, near integer filling factors, electrons should
        only be transmitted through spatially-separated edge states. However, in
        mesoscopic systems, electronic transmission turns out to be more complex,
        giving rise to a large spectrum of magnetoresistance oscillations. To explain
        these observations, recent models put forward that, as edge states come close
        to each other, electrons can hop between counterpropagating edge channels, or
        tunnel through Coulomb islands. Here, we use scanning gate microscopy to
        demonstrate the presence of quantum Hall Coulomb islands, and reveal the
        spatial structure of transport inside a quantum Hall interferometer. Electron
        islands locations are found by modulating the tunneling between edge states and
        confined electron orbits. Tuning the magnetic field, we unveil a continuous
        evolution of active electron islands. This allows to decrypt the complexity of
        high magnetic field magnetoresistance oscillations, and opens the way to
        further local scale manipulations of quantum Hall localized states.

            <title>Possible thermochemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of the
          exoplanet GJ 436b</title>
            <summary>  The nearby extrasolar planet GJ 436b--which has been labelled as a 'hot
        Neptune'--reveals itself by the dimming of light as it crosses in front of and
        behind its parent star as seen from Earth. Respectively known as the primary
        transit and secondary eclipse, the former constrains the planet's radius and
        mass, and the latter constrains the planet's temperature and, with measurements
        at multiple wavelengths, its atmospheric composition. Previous work using
        transmission spectroscopy failed to detect the 1.4-\mu m water vapour band,
        leaving the planet's atmospheric composition poorly constrained. Here we report
        the detection of planetary thermal emission from the dayside of GJ 436b at
        multiple infrared wavelengths during the secondary eclipse. The best-fit
        compositional models contain a high CO abundance and a substantial methane
        (CH4) deficiency relative to thermochemical equilibrium models for the
        predicted hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Moreover, we report the presence of
        some H2O and traces of CO2. Because CH4 is expected to be the dominant
        carbon-bearing species, disequilibrium processes such as vertical mixing and
        polymerization of methane into substances such as ethylene may be required to
        explain the hot Neptune's small CH4-to-CO ratio, which is at least 10^5 times
        smaller than predicted.

            <title>Noisy Kondo impurities</title>
            <summary>  The anti-ferromagnetic coupling of a magnetic impurity carrying a spin with
        the conduction electrons spins of a host metal is the basic mechanism
        responsible for the increase of the resistance of an alloy such as
        Cu${}_{0.998}$Fe${}_{0.002}$ at low temperature, as originally suggested by
        Kondo . This coupling has emerged as a very generic property of localized
        electronic states coupled to a continuum . The possibility to design artificial
        controllable magnetic impurities in nanoscopic conductors has opened a path to
        study this many body phenomenon in unusual situations as compared to the
        initial one and, in particular, in out of equilibrium situations. So far,
        measurements have focused on the average current. Here, we report on
        \textit{current fluctuations} (noise) measurements in artificial Kondo
        impurities made in carbon nanotube devices. We find a striking enhancement of
        the current noise within the Kondo resonance, in contradiction with simple
        non-interacting theories. Our findings provide a test bench for one of the most
        important many-body theories of condensed matter in out of equilibrium
        situations and shed light on the noise properties of highly conductive
        molecular devices.

            <title>Optimal quantum cloning of orbital angular momentum photon qubits via
          Hong-Ou-Mandel coalescence</title>
            <summary>  The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, associated with a helical
        structure of the wavefunction, has a great potential for quantum photonics, as
        it allows attaching a higher dimensional quantum space to each photon.
        Hitherto, however, the use of OAM has been hindered by its difficult
        manipulation. Here, exploiting the recently demonstrated spin-OAM information
        transfer tools, we report the first observation of the Hong-Ou-Mandel
        coalescence of two incoming photons having nonzero OAM into the same outgoing
        mode of a beam-splitter. The coalescence can be switched on and off by varying
        the input OAM state of the photons. Such effect has been then exploited to
        carry out the 1 \rightarrow 2 universal optimal quantum cloning of OAM-encoded
        qubits, using the symmetrization technique already developed for polarization.
        These results are finally shown to be scalable to quantum spaces of arbitrary
        dimension, even combining different degrees of freedom of the photons.

            <title>Hierarchical group dynamics in pigeon flocks</title>
            <summary>  Animals that travel together in groups display a variety of fascinating
        motion patterns thought to be the result of delicate local interactions among
        group members. Although the most informative way of investigating and
        interpreting collective movement phenomena would be afforded by the collection
        of high-resolution spatiotemporal data from moving individuals, such data are
        scarce and are virtually non-existent for long-distance group motion within a
        natural setting because of the associated technological difficulties. Here we
        present results of experiments in which track logs of homing pigeons flying in
        flocks of up to 10 individuals have been obtained by high-resolution
        lightweight GPS devices and analyzed using a variety of correlation functions
        inspired by approaches common in statistical physics. We find a well-defined
        hierarchy among flock members from data concerning leading roles in pairwise
        interactions, defined on the basis of characteristic delay times between birds'
        directional choices. The average spatial position of a pigeon within the flock
        strongly correlates with its place in the hierarchy, and birds respond more
        quickly to conspecifics perceived primarily through the left eye - both results
        revealing differential roles for birds that assume different positions with
        respect to flock-mates. From an evolutionary perspective, our results suggest
        that hierarchical organisation of group flight may be more efficient than an
        egalitarian one, at least for those flock sizes that permit regular pairwise
        interactions among group members, during which leader-follower relationships
        are consistently manifested.

            <title>Shapiro delay measurement of a two solar mass neutron star</title>
            <summary>  Neutron stars are composed of the densest form of matter known to exist in
        our universe, and thus provide a unique laboratory for exploring the properties
        of cold matter at super-nuclear density. Measurements of the masses or radii of
        these objects can strongly constrain the neutron-star matter equation of state,
        and consequently the interior composition of neutron stars. Neutron stars that
        are visible as millisecond radio pulsars are especially useful in this respect,
        as timing observations of the radio pulses provide an extremely precise probe
        of both the pulsar's motion and the surrounding space-time metric. In
        particular, for a pulsar in a binary system, detection of the general
        relativistic Shapiro delay allows us to infer the masses of both the neutron
        star and its binary companion to high precision. Here we present radio timing
        observations of the binary millisecond pulsar PSR J1614-2230, which show a
        strong Shapiro delay signature. The implied pulsar mass of 1.97 +/- 0.04 M_sun
        is by far the highest yet measured with such certainty, and effectively rules
        out the presence of hyperons, bosons, or free quarks at densities comparable to
        the nuclear saturation density.

            <title>Waves on the surface of the Orion molecular cloud</title>
            <summary>  Massive stars influence their parental molecular cloud, and it has long been
        suspected that the development of hydrodynamical instabilities can compress or
        fragment the cloud. Identifying such instabilities has proved difficult. It has
        been suggested that elongated structures (such as the `pillars of creation')
        and other shapes arise because of instabilities, but alternative explanations
        are available. One key signature of an instability is a wave-like structure in
        the gas, which has hitherto not been seen. Here we report the presence of
        `waves' at the surface of the Orion molecular cloud near where massive stars
        are forming. The waves seem to be a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that arises
        during the expansion of the nebula as gas heated and ionized by massive stars
        is blown over pre-existing molecular gas.

            <title>Type Ia Supernovae as Stellar Endpoints and Cosmological Tools</title>
            <summary>  Empirically, Type Ia supernovae are the most useful, precise, and mature
        tools for determining astronomical distances. Acting as calibrated candles they
        revealed the presence of dark energy and are being used to measure its
        properties. However, the nature of the SN Ia explosion, and the progenitors
        involved, have remained elusive, even after seven decades of research. But now
        new large surveys are bringing about a paradigm shift --- we can finally
        compare samples of hundreds of supernovae to isolate critical variables. As a
        result of this, and advances in modeling, breakthroughs in understanding all
        aspects of SNe Ia are finally starting to happen.

            <title>Coupled quantized mechanical oscillators</title>
            <summary>  The harmonic oscillator is one of the simplest physical systems but also one
        of the most fundamental. It is ubiquitous in nature, often serving as an
        approximation for a more complicated system or as a building block in larger
        models. Realizations of harmonic oscillators in the quantum regime include
        electromagnetic fields in a cavity [1-3] and the mechanical modes of a trapped
        atom [4] or macroscopic solid [5]. Quantized interaction between two motional
        modes of an individual trapped ion has been achieved by coupling through
        optical fields [6], and entangled motion of two ions in separate locations has
        been accomplished indirectly through their internal states [7]. However, direct
        controllable coupling between quantized mechanical oscillators held in separate
        locations has not been realized previously. Here we implement such coupling
        through the mutual Coulomb interaction of two ions held in trapping potentials
        separated by 40 um (similar work is reported in a related paper [8]). By tuning
        the confining wells into resonance, energy is exchanged between the ions at the
        quantum level, establishing that direct coherent motional coupling is possible
        for separately trapped ions. The system demonstrates a building block for
        quantum information processing and quantum simulation. More broadly, this work
        is a natural precursor to experiments in hybrid quantum systems, such as
        coupling a trapped ion to a quantized macroscopic mechanical or electrical
        oscillator [9-13].

            <title>Early star-forming galaxies and the reionization of the Universe</title>
            <summary>  Star forming galaxies represent a valuable tracer of cosmic history. Recent
        observational progress with Hubble Space Telescope has led to the discovery and
        study of the earliest-known galaxies corresponding to a period when the
        Universe was only ~800 million years old. Intense ultraviolet radiation from
        these early galaxies probably induced a major event in cosmic history: the
        reionization of intergalactic hydrogen. New techniques are being developed to
        understand the properties of these most distant galaxies and determine their
        influence on the evolution of the universe.

            <title>Strong Interactions of Single Atoms and Photons near a Dielectric
          Boundary</title>
            <summary>  Modern research in optical physics has achieved quantum control of strong
        interactions between a single atom and one photon within the setting of cavity
        quantum electrodynamics (cQED). However, to move beyond current
        proof-of-principle experiments involving one or two conventional optical
        cavities to more complex scalable systems that employ N &gt;&gt; 1 microscopic
        resonators requires the localization of individual atoms on distance scales &lt;
        100 nm from a resonator's surface. In this regime an atom can be strongly
        coupled to a single intracavity photon while at the same time experiencing
        significant radiative interactions with the dielectric boundaries of the
        resonator. Here, we report an initial step into this new regime of cQED by way
        of real-time detection and high-bandwidth feedback to select and monitor single
        Cesium atoms localized ~100 nm from the surface of a micro-toroidal optical
        resonator. We employ strong radiative interactions of atom and cavity field to
        probe atomic motion through the evanescent field of the resonator. Direct
        temporal and spectral measurements reveal both the significant role of
        Casimir-Polder attraction and the manifestly quantum nature of the atom-cavity
        dynamics. Our work sets the stage for trapping atoms near micro- and
        nano-scopic optical resonators for applications in quantum information science,
        including the creation of scalable quantum networks composed of many
        atom-cavity systems that coherently interact via coherent exchanges of single
        photons.

            <title>A Microscopic View on the Mott transition in Chromium-doped V2O3</title>
            <summary>  V2O3 is the prototype system for the Mott transition, one of the most
        fundamental phenomena of electronic correlation. Temperature, doping or
        pressure induce a metal to insulator transition (MIT) between a paramagnetic
        metal (PM) and a paramagnetic insulator (PI). This or related MITs have a high
        technological potential, among others for intelligent windows and field effect
        transistors. However the spatial scale on which such transitions develop is not
        known in spite of their importance for research and applications. Here we
        unveil for the first time the MIT in Cr-doped V2O3 with submicron lateral
        resolution: with decreasing temperature, microscopic domains become metallic
        and coexist with an insulating background. This explains why the associated PM
        phase is actually a poor metal. The phase separation can be associated with a
        thermodynamic instability near the transition. This instability is reduced by
        pressure which drives a genuine Mott transition to an eventually homogeneous
        metallic state.

            <summary>  We have developed a full discourse parser in the Penn Discourse Treebank
        (PDTB) style. Our trained parser first identifies all discourse and
        non-discourse relations, locates and labels their arguments, and then
        classifies their relation types. When appropriate, the attribution spans to
        these relations are also determined. We present a comprehensive evaluation from
        both component-wise and error-cascading perspectives.

            <title>Quantum computation with devices whose contents are never read</title>
            <summary>  In classical computation, a "write-only memory" (WOM) is little more than an
        oxymoron, and the addition of WOM to a (deterministic or probabilistic)
        classical computer brings no advantage. We prove that quantum computers that
        are augmented with WOM can solve problems that neither a classical computer
        with WOM nor a quantum computer without WOM can solve, when all other resource
        bounds are equal. We focus on realtime quantum finite automata, and examine the
        increase in their power effected by the addition of WOMs with different access
        modes and capacities. Some problems that are unsolvable by two-way
        probabilistic Turing machines using sublogarithmic amounts of read/write memory
        are shown to be solvable by these enhanced automata.

            <title>Consistent model of magnetism in ferropnictides</title>
            <summary>  The discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAsO introduced the ferropnictides
        as a major new class of superconducting compounds with critical temperatures
        second only to cuprates. The presence of magnetic iron makes ferropnictides
        radically different from cuprates. Antiferromagnetism of the parent compounds
        strongly suggests that superconductivity and magnetism are closely related.
        However, the character of magnetic interactions and spin fluctuations in
        ferropnictides, in spite of vigorous efforts, has until now resisted
        understanding within any conventional model of magnetism. Here we show that the
        most puzzling features can be naturally reconciled within a rather simple
        effective spin model with biquadratic interactions, which is consistent with
        electronic structure calculations. By going beyond the Heisenberg model, this
        description explains numerous experimentally observed properties, including the
        peculiarities of the spin wave spectrum, thin domain walls, crossover from
        first to second order phase transition under doping in some compounds, and
        offers new insight in the occurrence of the nematic phase above the
        antiferromagnetic phase transition.

            <title>Doorway States and Billiards</title>
            <summary>  Whenever a distinct state is immersed in a sea of complicated and dense
        states, the strength of the distinct state, which we refer to as a doorway, is
        distributed in their neighboring states. We analyze this mechanism for 2-D
        billiards with different geometries. One of them is symmetric and integrable,
        another is symmetric but chaotic, and the third has a capricious form. The fact
        that the doorway-state mechanism is valid for such highly diverse cases, proves
        that it is robust.

            <title>Trionic Optical Potential for Electrons in Semiconductors</title>
            <summary>  Laser-induced optical potentials for atoms have led to remarkable advances in
        precision measurement, quantum information, and towards addressing fundamental
        questions in condensed matter physics. Here, we describe analogous optical
        potentials for electrons in quantum wells and wires that can be generated by
        optically driving the transition between a single electron and a three-body
        electron-exciton bound state, known as a trion. The existence of a bound trion
        state adds a term to the ac Stark shift of the material proportional to the
        light intensity at the position of the electron. According to our theoretical
        calculations, this shift can be large relative to the thermal equilibrium
        temperature of the electron, resulting in a relatively strong optical potential
        that could be used to trap, guide, and manipulate individual electrons within a
        semiconductor quantum well or wire. These potentials can be thought of as
        artificial nano-structures on the scale of 100 nm that can be spin-dependent
        and reconfigurable in real-time. Our results suggest the possibility of
        integrating ultrafast optics and gate voltages in new resolved-carrier
        semiconductor opto-electronic devices, with potential applications in fields
        such as nano-electronics, spintronics, and quantum information processing

            <title>Circuit cavity electromechanics in the strong coupling regime</title>
            <summary>  Demonstrating and exploiting the quantum nature of larger, more macroscopic
        mechanical objects would help us to directly investigate the limitations of
        quantum-based measurements and quantum information protocols, as well as test
        long standing questions about macroscopic quantum coherence. The field of
        cavity opto- and electro-mechanics, in which a mechanical oscillator is
        parametrically coupled to an electromagnetic resonance, provides a practical
        architecture for the manipulation and detection of motion at the quantum level.
        Reaching this quantum level requires strong coupling, interaction timescales
        between the two systems that are faster than the time it takes for energy to be
        dissipated. By incorporating a free-standing, flexible aluminum membrane into a
        lumped-element superconducting resonant cavity, we have increased the single
        photon coupling strength between radio-frequency mechanical motion and resonant
        microwave photons by more than two orders of magnitude beyond the current
        state-of-the-art. A parametric drive tone at the difference frequency between
        the two resonant systems dramatically increases the overall coupling strength.
        This has allowed us to completely enter the strong coupling regime. This is
        evidenced by a maximum normal mode splitting of nearly six bare cavity
        line-widths. Spectroscopic measurements of these 'dressed states' are in
        excellent quantitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions. The basic
        architecture presented here provides a feasible path to ground-state cooling
        and subsequent coherent control and measurement of the quantum states of
        mechanical motion.

            <title>Single and two-particle energy gaps across the disorder-driven
          superconductor-insulator transition</title>
            <summary>  The competition between superconductivity and localization raises profound
        questions in condensed matter physics. In spite of decades of research, the
        mechanism of the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) and the nature of
        the insulator are not understood. We use quantum Monte Carlo simulations that
        treat, on an equal footing, inhomogeneous amplitude variations and phase
        fluctuations, a major advance over previous theories. We gain new microscopic
        insights and make testable predictions for local spectroscopic probes. The
        energy gap in the density of states survives across the transition, but
        coherence peaks exist only in the superconductor. A characteristic pseudogap
        persists above the critical disorder and critical temperature, in contrast to
        conventional theories. Surprisingly, the insulator has a two-particle gap scale
        that vanishes at the SIT, despite a robust single-particle gap.

            <title>Light-induced size changes in BiFeO3 crystals</title>
            <summary>  Multifunctional oxides are promising materials because of their fundamental
        physical properties as well as their potential in applications1. Among these
        materials, multiferroics exhibiting ferroelectricity and magnetism are good
        candidates for spin electronic applications using the magnetoelectric effect,
        which couples magnetism and ferroelecticity. Furthermore, because
        ferroelectrics are insulators with a reasonable bandgap, photons can
        efficiently interact with electrons leading to photoconduction or photovoltaic
        effects. However, until now, coupling of light with mechanical degrees of
        freedom has been elusive, although ferroelasticity is a well-known property of
        these materials. Here, we report on the observation, for the first time, of a
        substantial visiblelight- induced change in the dimensions of BiFeO3 crystals
        at room temperature. The relative light-induced photostrictive effect is of the
        order of 10e-5 with response times below 0.1s. It depends on the polarization
        of incident light as well as applied magnetic fields. This opens the
        perspective of combining mechanical, magnetic, electric and optical
        functionalities in future generations of remote switchable devices.

        proposed, WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) occupy a special place,
        as they arise naturally from well motivated extensions of the standard model of
        particle physics. With the advent of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, and a
        new generation of astroparticle experiments, the moment of truth has come for
        WIMPs: either we will discover them in the next five to ten years, or we will
        witness the inevitable decline of WIMP paradigm.

            <title>Extremely long quasiparticle spin lifetimes in superconducting aluminium
          using MgO tunnel spin injectors</title>
            <summary>  There has been an intense search in recent years for long-lived
        spin-polarized carriers for spintronic and quantum-computing devices. Here we
        report that spin polarized quasi-particles in superconducting aluminum layers
        have surprisingly long spin-lifetimes, nearly a million times longer than in
        their normal state. The lifetime is determined from the suppression of the
        aluminum's superconductivity resulting from the accumulation of spin polarized
        carriers in the aluminum layer using tunnel spin injectors. A Hanle effect,
        observed in the presence of small in-plane orthogonal fields, is shown to be
        quantitatively consistent with the presence of long-lived spin polarized
        quasi-particles. Our experiments show that the superconducting state can be
        significantly modified by small electric currents, much smaller than the
        critical current, which is potentially useful for devices involving
        superconducting qubits.

            <title>Trapped-ion antennae for the transmission of quantum information</title>
            <summary>  More than one hundred years ago Heinrich Hertz succeeded in transmitting
        signals over a few meters to a receiving antenna using an electromagnetic
        oscillator and thus proving the electromagnetic theory developed by James C.
        Maxwell[1]. Since then, technology has developed, and today a variety of
        oscillators is available at the quantum mechanical level. For quantized
        electromagnetic oscillations atoms in cavities can be used to couple electric
        fields[2, 3]. For mechanical oscillators realized, for example, with
        cantilevers[4, 5] or vibrational modes of trapped atoms[6] or ions[7, 8], a
        quantum mechanical link between two such oscillators has, to date, been
        demonstrated in very few cases and has only been achieved in indirect ways.
        Examples of this include the mechanical transport of atoms carrying the quantum
        information[9] or the use of spontaneously emitted photons[10]. In this work,
        direct coupling between the motional dipoles of separately trapped ions is
        achieved over a distance of 54 {\mu}m, using the dipole-dipole interaction as a
        quantum-mechanical transmission line[11]. This interaction is small between
        single trapped ions, but the coupling is amplified by using additional trapped
        ions as antennae. With three ions in each well the interaction is increased by
        a factor of seven as compared to the singleion case. This enhancement
        facilitates bridging of larger distances and relaxes the constraints on the
        miniaturization of trap electrodes. This represents a new building block for
        quantum computation and also offers new opportunities to couple quantum systems
        of different natures.

            <title>Field-induced water electrolysis switches an oxide semiconductor from an
          insulator to a metal</title>
            <summary>  Here we demonstrate that water-infiltrated nanoporous glass electrically
        switches an oxide semiconductor from an insulator to metal. We fabricated the
        field effect transistor structure on an oxide semiconductor, SrTiO3, using
        100%-water-infiltrated nanoporous glass - amorphous 12CaO*7Al2O3 - as the gate
        insulator. For positive gate voltage, electron accumulation, water electrolysis
        and electrochemical reduction occur successively on the SrTiO3 surface at room
        temperature, leading to the formation of a thin (~3 nm) metal layer with an
        extremely high electron concentration of 10^15-10^16 cm^-2, which exhibits
        exotic thermoelectric behaviour.

            <title>Topological semimetal in a fermionic optical lattice</title>
            <summary>  Optical lattices play a versatile role in advancing our understanding of
        correlated quantum matter. The recent implementation of orbital degrees of
        freedom in chequerboard and hexagonal optical lattices opens up a new thrust
        towards discovering novel quantum states of matter, which have no prior analogs
        in solid state electronic materials. Here, we demonstrate that an exotic
        topological semimetal emerges as a parity-protected gapless state in the
        orbital bands of a two-dimensional fermionic optical lattice. The new quantum
        state is characterized by a parabolic band-degeneracy point with Berry flux
        $2\pi$, in sharp contrast to the $\pi$ flux of Dirac points as in graphene. We
        prove that the appearance of this topological liquid is universal for all
        lattices with D$_4$ point group symmetry as long as orbitals with opposite
        parities hybridize strongly with each other and the band degeneracy is
        protected by odd parity. Turning on inter-particle repulsive interactions, the
        system undergoes a phase transition to a topological insulator whose
        experimental signature includes chiral gapless domain-wall modes, reminiscent
        of quantum Hall edge states.

            <title>Interaction and filling induced quantum phases of dual Mott insulators
          of bosons and fermions</title>
            <summary>  Many-body effects are at the very heart of diverse phenomena found in
        condensed-matter physics. One striking example is the Mott insulator phase
        where conductivity is suppressed as a result of a strong repulsive interaction.
        Advances in cold atom physics have led to the realization of the Mott
        insulating phases of atoms in an optical lattice, mimicking the corresponding
        condensed matter systems. Here, we explore an exotic strongly-correlated system
        of Interacting Dual Mott Insulators of bosons and fermions. We reveal that an
        inter-species interaction between bosons and fermions drastically modifies each
        Mott insulator, causing effects that include melting, generation of composite
        particles, an anti-correlated phase, and complete phase-separation. Comparisons
        between the experimental results and numerical simulations indicate intrinsic
        adiabatic heating and cooling for the attractively and repulsively interacting
        dual Mott Insulators, respectively.

            <title>Control and Characterization of Individual Grains and Grain Boundaries
          in Graphene Grown by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
            <summary>  The strong interest in graphene has motivated the scalable production of high
        quality graphene and graphene devices. Since large-scale graphene films
        synthesized to date are typically polycrystalline, it is important to
        characterize and control grain boundaries, generally believed to degrade
        graphene quality. Here we study single-crystal graphene grains synthesized by
        ambient CVD on polycrystalline Cu, and show how individual boundaries between
        coalescing grains affect graphene's electronic properties. The graphene grains
        show no definite epitaxial relationship with the Cu substrate, and can cross Cu
        grain boundaries. The edges of these grains are found to be predominantly
        parallel to zigzag directions. We show that grain boundaries give a significant
        Raman "D" peak, impede electrical transport, and induce prominent weak
        localization indicative of intervalley scattering in graphene. Finally, we
        demonstrate an approach using pre-patterned growth seeds to control graphene
        nucleation, opening a route towards scalable fabrication of single-crystal
        graphene devices without grain boundaries.

            <title>Observation of the thermal Casimir force</title>
            <summary>  Quantum theory predicts the existence of the Casimir force between
        macroscopic bodies, due to the zero-point energy of electromagnetic field modes
        around them. This quantum fluctuation-induced force has been experimentally
        observed for metallic and semiconducting bodies, although the measurements to
        date have been unable to clearly settle the question of the correct
        low-frequency form of the dielectric constant dispersion (the Drude model or
        the plasma model) to be used for calculating the Casimir forces. At finite
        temperature a thermal Casimir force, due to thermal, rather than quantum,
        fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, has been theoretically predicted
        long ago. Here we report the experimental observation of the thermal Casimir
        force between two gold plates. We measured the attractive force between a flat
        and a spherical plate for separations between 0.7 $\mu$m and 7 $\mu$m. An
        electrostatic force caused by potential patches on the plates' surfaces is
        included in the analysis. The experimental results are in excellent agreement
        (reduced $\chi^2$ of 1.04) with the Casimir force calculated using the Drude
        model, including the T=300 K thermal force, which dominates over the quantum
        fluctuation-induced force at separations greater than 3 $\mu$m. The plasma
        model result is excluded in the measured separation range.

            <title>Advantageous grain boundaries in iron pnictide superconductors</title>
            <summary>  High critical temperature superconductors have zero power consumption and
        could be used to produce ideal electric power lines. The principal obstacle in
        fabricating superconducting wires and tapes is grain boundaries-the
        misalignment of crystalline orientations at grain boundaries, which is
        unavoidable for polycrystals, largely deteriorates critical current density.
        Here, we report that High critical temperature iron pnictide superconductors
        have advantages over cuprates with respect to these grain boundary issues. The
        transport properties through well-defined bicrystal grain boundary junctions
        with various misorientation angles (thetaGB) were systematically investigated
        for cobalt-doped BaFe2As2 (BaFe2As2:Co) epitaxial films fabricated on bicrystal
        substrates. The critical current density through bicrystal grain boundary
        (JcBGB) remained high (&gt; 1 MA/cm2) and nearly constant up to a critical angle
        thetac of ~9o, which is substantially larger than the thetac of ~5o for YBCO.
        Even at thetaGB &gt; thetac, the decay of JcBGB was much smaller than that of
        YBCO.

            <title>Operational approach to open dynamics and quantifying initial
          correlations</title>
            <summary>  A central aim of physics is to describe the dynamics of physical systems.
        Schrodinger's equation does this for isolated quantum systems. Describing the
        time evolution of a quantum system that interacts with its environment, in its
        most general form, has proved to be difficult because the dynamics is dependent
        on the state of the environment and the correlations with it. For discrete
        processes, such as quantum gates or chemical reactions, quantum process
        tomography provides the complete description of the dynamics, provided that the
        initial states of the system and the environment are independent of each other.
        However, many physical systems are correlated with the environment at the
        beginning of the experiment. Here, we give a prescription of quantum process
        tomography that yields the complete description of the dynamics of the system
        even when the initial correlations are present. Surprisingly, our method also
        gives quantitative expressions for the initial correlation.

            <title>Criticality and isostaticity in fiber networks</title>
            <summary>  The rigidity of elastic networks depends sensitively on their internal
        connectivity and the nature of the interactions between constituents. Particles
        interacting via central forces undergo a zero-temperature rigidity-percolation
        transition near the isostatic threshold, where the constraints and internal
        degrees of freedom are equal in number. Fibrous networks, such as those that
        form the cellular cytoskeleton, become rigid at a lower threshold due to
        additional bending constraints. However, the degree to which bending governs
        network mechanics remains a subject of considerable debate. We study disordered
        fibrous networks with variable coordination number, both above and below the
        central-force isostatic point. This point controls a broad crossover from
        stretching- to bending-dominated elasticity. Strikingly, this crossover
        exhibits an anomalous power-law dependence of the shear modulus on both
        stretching and bending rigidities. At the central-force isostatic point---well
        above the rigidity threshold---we find divergent strain fluctuations together
        with a divergent correlation length $\xi$, implying a breakdown of continuum
        elasticity in this simple mechanical system on length scales less than $\xi$.

            <title>Experimental investigation of the uncertainty principle in the presence
          of quantum memory</title>
            <summary>  Heisenberg's uncertainty principle provides a fundamental limitation on an
        observer's ability to simultaneously predict the outcome when one of two
        measurements is performed on a quantum system. However, if the observer has
        access to a particle (stored in a quantum memory) which is entangled with the
        system, his uncertainty is generally reduced. This effect has recently been
        quantified by Berta et al. [Nature Physics 6, 659 (2010)] in a new, more
        general uncertainty relation, formulated in terms of entropies. Using entangled
        photon pairs, an optical delay line serving as a quantum memory and fast,
        active feed-forward we experimentally probe the validity of this new relation.
        The behaviour we find agrees with the predictions of quantum theory and
        satisfies the new uncertainty relation. In particular, we find lower
        uncertainties about the measurement outcomes than would be possible without the
        entangled particle. This shows not only that the reduction in uncertainty
        enabled by entanglement can be significant in practice, but also demonstrates
        the use of the inequality to witness entanglement.

            <title>Appearance of fluctuating stripes at the onset of the pseudogap in the
          high-Tc Superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x</title>
            <summary>  Doped Mott insulators have been shown to have a strong propensity to form
        patterns of holes and spins often referred to as stripes. In copper-oxides,
        doping also gives rise to the pseudogap state, which transforms into a high
        temperature superconductor with sufficient doping or by reducing the
        temperature. A long standing question has been the interplay between pseudogap,
        which is generic to all hole-doped cuprates, and stripes, whose static form
        occurs in only one family of cuprates over a narrow range of the phase diagram.
        Here we examine the spatial reorganization of electronic states with the onset
        of the pseudogap state at T* in the high-temperature superconductor
        Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x using spectroscopic mapping with the scanning tunneling
        microscope (STM). We find that the onset of the pseudogap phase coincides with
        the appearance of electronic patterns that have the predicted characteristics
        of fluctuating stripes. As expected, the stripe patterns are strongest when the
        hole concentration in the CuO2 planes is close to 1/8 (per Cu). While
        demonstrating that the fluctuating stripes emerge with the onset of the
        pseudogap state and occur over a large part of the cuprate phase diagram, our
        experiments indicate that they are a consequence of pseudogap behavior rather
        than its cause.

            <title>Experimental investigation of the entanglement-assisted entropic
          uncertainty principle</title>
            <summary>  The uncertainty principle, which bounds the uncertainties involved in
        obtaining precise outcomes for two complementary variables defining a quantum
        particle, is a crucial aspect in quantum mechanics. Recently, the uncertainty
        principle in terms of entropy has been extended to the case involving quantum
        entanglement. With previously obtained quantum information for the particle of
        interest, the outcomes of both non-commuting observables can be predicted
        precisely, which greatly generalises the uncertainty relation. Here, we
        experimentally investigated the entanglement-assisted entropic uncertainty
        principle for an entirely optical setup. The uncertainty is shown to be near
        zero in the presence of quasi-maximal entanglement. The new uncertainty
        relation is further used to witness entanglement. The verified entropic
        uncertainty relation provides an intriguing perspective in that it implies the
        uncertainty principle is not only observable-dependent but is also
        observer-dependent.

            <title>Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray Acceleration in Engine-driven Relativistic
          Supernovae</title>
            <summary>  The origin of the highest energy cosmic rays remains an enigma. They offer a
        window to new physics, including tests of physical laws relevant to their
        propagation and interactions, at energies unattainable by terrestrial
        accelerators. They must be accelerated locally, as otherwise background
        radiations would severely suppress the flux of protons and nuclei, at energies
        above the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) limit. Nearby Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs),
        Hypernovae, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and their flares, have all been
        suggested and debated as possible sources. A local sub-population of type Ibc
        supernovae (SNe) with mildly relativistic outflows have been detected as
        sub-energetic GRBs or X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) and recently as radio afterglows
        without detected GRB counterparts. We measure the size-magnetic field
        evolution, baryon loading and energetics, using the observed radio spectra of
        SN 2009bb. We place such engine-driven SNe above the Hillas line and establish
        that they can readily explain the post-GZK UHECRs.

            <title>Observation of shell effects in superconducting nanoparticles of Sn</title>
            <summary>  In a zero-dimensional superconductor, quantum size effects(QSE) not only set
        the limit to superconductivity, but are also at the heart of new phenomena such
        as shell effects, which have been predicted to result in large enhancements of
        the superconducting energy gap. Here, we experimentally demonstrate these QSE
        through measurements on single, isolated Pb and Sn nanoparticles. In both
        systems superconductivity is ultimately quenched at sizes governed by the
        dominance of the quantum fluctuations of the order parameter. However, before
        the destruction of superconductivity, in Sn nanoparticles we observe giant
        oscillations in the superconducting energy gap with particle size leading to
        enhancements as large as 60%. These oscillations are the first experimental
        proof of coherent shell effects in nanoscale superconductors. Contrarily, we
        observe no such oscillations in the gap for Pb nanoparticles, which is ascribed
        to the suppression of shell effects for shorter coherence lengths. Our study
        paves the way to exploit QSE in boosting superconductivity in low-dimensional
        systems.

            <title>Ultrafast changes in lattice symmetry probed by coherent phonons</title>
            <summary>  The electronic and structural properties of a material are strongly
        determined by its symmetry. Changing the symmetry via a photoinduced phase
        transition offers new ways to manipulate material properties on ultrafast
        timescales. However, in order to identify when and how fast these phase
        transitions occur, methods that can probe the symmetry change in the time
        domain are required. We show that a time-dependent change in the coherent
        phonon spectrum can probe a change in symmetry of the lattice potential, thus
        providing an all-optical probe of structural transitions. We examine the
        photoinduced structural phase transition in VO2 and show that, above the phase
        transition threshold, photoexcitation completely changes the lattice potential
        on an ultrafast timescale. The loss of the equilibrium-phase phonon modes
        occurs promptly, indicating a non-thermal pathway for the photoinduced phase
        transition, where a strong perturbation to the lattice potential changes its
        symmetry before ionic rearrangement has occurred.

            <title>Modeling the scaling properties of human mobility</title>
            <summary>  While the fat tailed jump size and the waiting time distributions
        characterizing individual human trajectories strongly suggest the relevance of
        the continuous time random walk (CTRW) models of human mobility, no one
        seriously believes that human traces are truly random. Given the importance of
        human mobility, from epidemic modeling to traffic prediction and urban
        planning, we need quantitative models that can account for the statistical
        characteristics of individual human trajectories. Here we use empirical data on
        human mobility, captured by mobile phone traces, to show that the predictions
        of the CTRW models are in systematic conflict with the empirical results. We
        introduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a
        statistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility.
        The model not only accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws but also
        allows us to analytically predict most of the pertinent scaling exponents.

            <title>Approximating Mexican highways with slime mould</title>
            <summary>  Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a single cell visible by unaided eye.
        During its foraging behavior the cell spans spatially distributed sources of
        nutrients with a protoplasmic network. Geometrical structure of the
        protoplasmic networks allows the plasmodium to optimize transport of nutrients
        between remote parts of its body. Assuming major Mexican cities are sources of
        nutrients how much structure of Physarum protoplasmic network correspond to
        structure of Mexican Federal highway network? To find an answer undertook a
        series of laboratory experiments with living Physarum polycephalum. We
        represent geographical locations of major cities by oat flakes, place a piece
        of plasmodium in Mexico city area, record the plasmodium's foraging behavior
        and extract topology of nutrient transport networks. Results of our experiments
        show that the protoplasmic network formed by Physarum is isomorphic, subject to
        limitations imposed, to a network of principle highways. Ideas and results of
        the paper may contribute towards future developments in bio-inspired road
        planning.

            <title>Creation and control of a two-dimensional electron liquid at the bare
          SrTiO3 surface</title>
            <summary>  Many-body interactions in transition-metal oxides give rise to a wide range
        of functional properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, colossal
        magnetoresistance, or multiferroicity. The seminal recent discovery of a
        two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of the insulating oxides
        LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 represents an important milestone towards exploiting such
        properties in all-oxide devices. This conducting interface shows a number of
        appealing properties, including a high electron mobility, superconductivity,
        and large magnetoresistance and can be patterned on the few-nanometer length
        scale. However, the microscopic origin of the interface 2DEG is poorly
        understood. Here, we show that a similar 2DEG, with an electron density as
        large as 8x10^13 cm^-2, can be formed at the bare SrTiO3 surface. Furthermore,
        we find that the 2DEG density can be controlled through exposure of the surface
        to intense ultraviolet (UV) light. Subsequent angle-resolved photoemission
        spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal an unusual coexistence of a light
        quasiparticle mass and signatures of strong many-body interactions.

            <title>Quantum gravitational contributions to quantum electrodynamics</title>
            <summary>  Quantum electrodynamics describes the interactions of electrons and photons.
        Electric charge (the gauge coupling constant) is energy dependent, and there is
        a previous claim that charge is affected by gravity (described by general
        relativity) with the implication that the charge is reduced at high energies.
        But that claim has been very controversial with the situation inconclusive.
        Here I report an analysis (free from earlier controversies) demonstrating that
        that quantum gravity corrections to quantum electrodynamics have a quadratic
        energy dependence that result in the reduction of the electric charge at high
        energies, a result known as asymptotic freedom.

            <title>Quantum networks reveal quantum nonlocality</title>
            <summary>  The results of local measurements on some composite quantum systems cannot be
        reproduced classically. This impossibility, known as quantum nonlocality,
        represents a milestone in the foundations of quantum theory. Quantum
        nonlocality is also a valuable resource for information processing tasks, e.g.
        quantum communication, quantum key distribution, quantum state estimation, or
        randomness extraction. Still, deciding if a quantum state is nonlocal remains a
        challenging problem. Here we introduce a novel approach to this question: we
        study the nonlocal properties of quantum states when distributed and measured
        in networks. Using our framework, we show how any one-way entanglement
        distillable state leads to nonlocal correlations. Then, we prove that
        nonlocality is a non-additive resource, which can be activated. There exist
        states, local at the single-copy level, that become nonlocal when taking
        several copies of it. Our results imply that the nonlocality of quantum states
        strongly depends on the measurement context.

            <summary>While the fat tailed jump size and the waiting time distributions characterizing individual human trajectories strongly suggest the relevance of the continuous time random walk (CTRW) models of human mobility, no one seriously believes that human traces are truly random. Given the importance of human mobility, from epidemic modeling to traffic prediction and urban planning, we need quantitative models that can account for the statistical characteristics of individual human trajectories. Here we use empirical data on human mobility, captured by mobile phone traces, to show that the predictions of the CTRW models are in systematic conflict with the empirical results. We introduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a statistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility. The model not only accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws but also allows us to analytically predict most of the pertinent scaling exponents.</summary>

            <title>High star formation rates as the origin of turbulence in early and modern disk galaxies</title>

            <summary>High spatial and spectral resolution observations of star formation and kinematics in early galaxies have shown that two-thirds are massive rotating disk galaxies with the remainder being less massive non-rotating objects. The line of sight averaged velocity dispersions are typically five times higher than in today's disk galaxies. This has suggested that gravitationally-unstable, gas-rich disks in the early Universe are fuelled by cold, dense accreting gas flowing along cosmic filaments and penetrating hot galactic gas halos. However these accreting flows have not been observed, and cosmic accretion cannot power the observed level of turbulence. Here we report on a new sample of rare high-velocity-dispersion disk galaxies we have discovered in the nearby Universe where cold accretion is unlikely to drive their high star-formation rates. We find that the velocity dispersion is most fundamentally correlated with their star-formation rates, and not their mass nor gas fraction, which leads to a new picture where star formation itself is the energetic driver of galaxy disk turbulence at all cosmic epochs.</summary>

            <summary>While the fat tailed jump size and the waiting time distributions characterizing individual human trajectories strongly suggest the relevance of the continuous time random walk (CTRW) models of human mobility, no one seriously believes that human traces are truly random. Given the importance of human mobility, from epidemic modeling to traffic prediction and urban planning, we need quantitative models that can account for the statistical characteristics of individual human trajectories. Here we use empirical data on human mobility, captured by mobile phone traces, to show that the predictions of the CTRW models are in systematic conflict with the empirical results. We introduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a statistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility. The model not only accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws but also allows us to analytically predict most of the pertinent scaling exponents.</summary>

            <summary>Many-body interactions in transition-metal oxides give rise to a wide range of functional properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, or multiferroicity. The seminal recent discovery of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of the insulating oxides LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 represents an important milestone towards exploiting such properties in all-oxide devices. This conducting interface shows a number of appealing properties, including a high electron mobility, superconductivity, and large magnetoresistance and can be patterned on the few-nanometer length scale. However, the microscopic origin of the interface 2DEG is poorly understood. Here, we show that a similar 2DEG, with an electron density as large as 8x10^13 cm^-2, can be formed at the bare SrTiO3 surface. Furthermore, we find that the 2DEG density can be controlled through exposure of the surface to intense ultraviolet (UV) light. Subsequent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal an unusual coexistence of a light quasiparticle mass and signatures of strong many-body interactions.</summary>

            <summary>High spatial and spectral resolution observations of star formation and kinematics in early galaxies have shown that two-thirds are massive rotating disk galaxies with the remainder being less massive non-rotating objects. The line of sight averaged velocity dispersions are typically five times higher than in today's disk galaxies. This has suggested that gravitationally-unstable, gas-rich disks in the early Universe are fuelled by cold, dense accreting gas flowing along cosmic filaments and penetrating hot galactic gas halos. However these accreting flows have not been observed, and cosmic accretion cannot power the observed level of turbulence. Here we report on a new sample of rare high-velocity-dispersion disk galaxies we have discovered in the nearby Universe where cold accretion is unlikely to drive their high star-formation rates. We find that the velocity dispersion is most fundamentally correlated with their star-formation rates, and not their mass nor gas fraction, which leads to a new picture where star formation itself is the energetic driver of galaxy disk turbulence at all cosmic epochs.</summary>

            <summary>While the fat tailed jump size and the waiting time distributions characterizing individual human trajectories strongly suggest the relevance of the continuous time random walk (CTRW) models of human mobility, no one seriously believes that human traces are truly random. Given the importance of human mobility, from epidemic modeling to traffic prediction and urban planning, we need quantitative models that can account for the statistical characteristics of individual human trajectories. Here we use empirical data on human mobility, captured by mobile phone traces, to show that the predictions of the CTRW models are in systematic conflict with the empirical results. We introduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a statistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility. The model not only accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws but also allows us to analytically predict most of the pertinent scaling exponents.</summary>

            <summary>Many-body interactions in transition-metal oxides give rise to a wide range of functional properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, or multiferroicity. The seminal recent discovery of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of the insulating oxides LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 represents an important milestone towards exploiting such properties in all-oxide devices. This conducting interface shows a number of appealing properties, including a high electron mobility, superconductivity, and large magnetoresistance and can be patterned on the few-nanometer length scale. However, the microscopic origin of the interface 2DEG is poorly understood. Here, we show that a similar 2DEG, with an electron density as large as 8x10^13 cm^-2, can be formed at the bare SrTiO3 surface. Furthermore, we find that the 2DEG density can be controlled through exposure of the surface to intense ultraviolet (UV) light. Subsequent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal an unusual coexistence of a light quasiparticle mass and signatures of strong many-body interactions.</summary>

            <summary>Quantum electrodynamics describes the interactions of electrons and photons. Electric charge (the gauge coupling constant) is energy dependent, and there is a previous claim that charge is affected by gravity (described by general relativity) with the implication that the charge is reduced at high energies. But that claim has been very controversial with the situation inconclusive. Here I report an analysis (free from earlier controversies) demonstrating that that quantum gravity corrections to quantum electrodynamics have a quadratic energy dependence that result in the reduction of the electric charge at high energies, a result known as asymptotic freedom.</summary>

            <summary>The results of local measurements on some composite quantum systems cannot be reproduced classically. This impossibility, known as quantum nonlocality, represents a milestone in the foundations of quantum theory. Quantum nonlocality is also a valuable resource for information processing tasks, e.g. quantum communication, quantum key distribution, quantum state estimation, or randomness extraction. Still, deciding if a quantum state is nonlocal remains a challenging problem. Here we introduce a novel approach to this question: we study the nonlocal properties of quantum states when distributed and measured in networks. Using our framework, we show how any one-way entanglement distillable state leads to nonlocal correlations. Then, we prove that nonlocality is a non-additive resource, which can be activated. There exist states, local at the single-copy level, that become nonlocal when taking several copies of it. Our results imply that the nonlocality of quantum states strongly depends on the measurement context.</summary>

            <summary>While the fat tailed jump size and the waiting time distributions characterizing individual human trajectories strongly suggest the relevance of the continuous time random walk (CTRW) models of human mobility, no one seriously believes that human traces are truly random. Given the importance of human mobility, from epidemic modeling to traffic prediction and urban planning, we need quantitative models that can account for the statistical characteristics of individual human trajectories. Here we use empirical data on human mobility, captured by mobile phone traces, to show that the predictions of the CTRW models are in systematic conflict with the empirical results. We introduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a statistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility. The model not only accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws but also allows us to analytically predict most of the pertinent scaling exponents.</summary>

            <summary>Many-body interactions in transition-metal oxides give rise to a wide range of functional properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, or multiferroicity. The seminal recent discovery of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of the insulating oxides LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 represents an important milestone towards exploiting such properties in all-oxide devices. This conducting interface shows a number of appealing properties, including a high electron mobility, superconductivity, and large magnetoresistance and can be patterned on the few-nanometer length scale. However, the microscopic origin of the interface 2DEG is poorly understood. Here, we show that a similar 2DEG, with an electron density as large as 8x10^13 cm^-2, can be formed at the bare SrTiO3 surface. Furthermore, we find that the 2DEG density can be controlled through exposure of the surface to intense ultraviolet (UV) light. Subsequent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal an unusual coexistence of a light quasiparticle mass and signatures of strong many-body interactions.</summary>

            <summary>Quantum electrodynamics describes the interactions of electrons and photons. Electric charge (the gauge coupling constant) is energy dependent, and there is a previous claim that charge is affected by gravity (described by general relativity) with the implication that the charge is reduced at high energies. But that claim has been very controversial with the situation inconclusive. Here I report an analysis (free from earlier controversies) demonstrating that that quantum gravity corrections to quantum electrodynamics have a quadratic energy dependence that result in the reduction of the electric charge at high energies, a result known as asymptotic freedom.</summary>

            <summary>The results of local measurements on some composite quantum systems cannot be reproduced classically. This impossibility, known as quantum nonlocality, represents a milestone in the foundations of quantum theory. Quantum nonlocality is also a valuable resource for information processing tasks, e.g. quantum communication, quantum key distribution, quantum state estimation, or randomness extraction. Still, deciding if a quantum state is nonlocal remains a challenging problem. Here we introduce a novel approach to this question: we study the nonlocal properties of quantum states when distributed and measured in networks. Using our framework, we show how any one-way entanglement distillable state leads to nonlocal correlations. Then, we prove that nonlocality is a non-additive resource, which can be activated. There exist states, local at the single-copy level, that become nonlocal when taking several copies of it. Our results imply that the nonlocality of quantum states strongly depends on the measurement context.</summary>

            <summary>High spatial and spectral resolution observations of star formation and kinematics in early galaxies have shown that two-thirds are massive rotating disk galaxies with the remainder being less massive non-rotating objects. The line of sight averaged velocity dispersions are typically five times higher than in today's disk galaxies. This has suggested that gravitationally-unstable, gas-rich disks in the early Universe are fuelled by cold, dense accreting gas flowing along cosmic filaments and penetrating hot galactic gas halos. However these accreting flows have not been observed, and cosmic accretion cannot power the observed level of turbulence. Here we report on a new sample of rare high-velocity-dispersion disk galaxies we have discovered in the nearby Universe where cold accretion is unlikely to drive their high star-formation rates. We find that the velocity dispersion is most fundamentally correlated with their star-formation rates, and not their mass nor gas fraction, which leads to a new picture where star formation itself is the energetic driver of galaxy disk turbulence at all cosmic epochs.</summary>

            <summary>Quantum electrodynamics describes the interactions of electrons and photons. Electric charge (the gauge coupling constant) is energy dependent, and there is a previous claim that charge is affected by gravity (described by general relativity) with the implication that the charge is reduced at high energies. But that claim has been very controversial with the situation inconclusive. Here I report an analysis (free from earlier controversies) demonstrating that that quantum gravity corrections to quantum electrodynamics have a quadratic energy dependence that result in the reduction of the electric charge at high energies, a result known as asymptotic freedom.</summary>

            <summary>The results of local measurements on some composite quantum systems cannot be reproduced classically. This impossibility, known as quantum nonlocality, represents a milestone in the foundations of quantum theory. Quantum nonlocality is also a valuable resource for information processing tasks, e.g. quantum communication, quantum key distribution, quantum state estimation, or randomness extraction. Still, deciding if a quantum state is nonlocal remains a challenging problem. Here we introduce a novel approach to this question: we study the nonlocal properties of quantum states when distributed and measured in networks. Using our framework, we show how any one-way entanglement distillable state leads to nonlocal correlations. Then, we prove that nonlocality is a non-additive resource, which can be activated. There exist states, local at the single-copy level, that become nonlocal when taking several copies of it. Our results imply that the nonlocality of quantum states strongly depends on the measurement context.</summary>

            <title>High star formation rates as the origin of turbulence in early and modern disk galaxies</title>

            <summary>High spatial and spectral resolution observations of star formation and kinematics in early galaxies have shown that two-thirds are massive rotating disk galaxies with the remainder being less massive non-rotating objects. The line of sight averaged velocity dispersions are typically five times higher than in today's disk galaxies. This has suggested that gravitationally-unstable, gas-rich disks in the early Universe are fuelled by cold, dense accreting gas flowing along cosmic filaments and penetrating hot galactic gas halos. However these accreting flows have not been observed, and cosmic accretion cannot power the observed level of turbulence. Here we report on a new sample of rare high-velocity-dispersion disk galaxies we have discovered in the nearby Universe where cold accretion is unlikely to drive their high star-formation rates. We find that the velocity dispersion is most fundamentally correlated with their star-formation rates, and not their mass nor gas fraction, which leads to a new picture where star formation itself is the energetic driver of galaxy disk turbulence at all cosmic epochs.</summary>

            <title>High star formation rates as the origin of turbulence in early and modern disk galaxies</title>

            <summary>High spatial and spectral resolution observations of star formation and kinematics in early galaxies have shown that two-thirds are massive rotating disk galaxies with the remainder being less massive non-rotating objects. The line of sight averaged velocity dispersions are typically five times higher than in today's disk galaxies. This has suggested that gravitationally-unstable, gas-rich disks in the early Universe are fuelled by cold, dense accreting gas flowing along cosmic filaments and penetrating hot galactic gas halos. However these accreting flows have not been observed, and cosmic accretion cannot power the observed level of turbulence. Here we report on a new sample of rare high-velocity-dispersion disk galaxies we have discovered in the nearby Universe where cold accretion is unlikely to drive their high star-formation rates. We find that the velocity dispersion is most fundamentally correlated with their star-formation rates, and not their mass nor gas fraction, which leads to a new picture where star formation itself is the energetic driver of galaxy disk turbulence at all cosmic epochs.</summary>

            <summary>While the fat tailed jump size and the waiting time distributions characterizing individual human trajectories strongly suggest the relevance of the continuous time random walk (CTRW) models of human mobility, no one seriously believes that human traces are truly random. Given the importance of human mobility, from epidemic modeling to traffic prediction and urban planning, we need quantitative models that can account for the statistical characteristics of individual human trajectories. Here we use empirical data on human mobility, captured by mobile phone traces, to show that the predictions of the CTRW models are in systematic conflict with the empirical results. We introduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a statistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility. The model not only accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws but also allows us to analytically predict most of the pertinent scaling exponents.</summary>

            <summary>Many-body interactions in transition-metal oxides give rise to a wide range of functional properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, or multiferroicity. The seminal recent discovery of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of the insulating oxides LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 represents an important milestone towards exploiting such properties in all-oxide devices. This conducting interface shows a number of appealing properties, including a high electron mobility, superconductivity, and large magnetoresistance and can be patterned on the few-nanometer length scale. However, the microscopic origin of the interface 2DEG is poorly understood. Here, we show that a similar 2DEG, with an electron density as large as 8x10^13 cm^-2, can be formed at the bare SrTiO3 surface. Furthermore, we find that the 2DEG density can be controlled through exposure of the surface to intense ultraviolet (UV) light. Subsequent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal an unusual coexistence of a light quasiparticle mass and signatures of strong many-body interactions.</summary>

            <summary>High spatial and spectral resolution observations of star formation and kinematics in early galaxies have shown that two-thirds are massive rotating disk galaxies with the remainder being less massive non-rotating objects. The line of sight averaged velocity dispersions are typically five times higher than in today's disk galaxies. This has suggested that gravitationally-unstable, gas-rich disks in the early Universe are fuelled by cold, dense accreting gas flowing along cosmic filaments and penetrating hot galactic gas halos. However these accreting flows have not been observed, and cosmic accretion cannot power the observed level of turbulence. Here we report on a new sample of rare high-velocity-dispersion disk galaxies we have discovered in the nearby Universe where cold accretion is unlikely to drive their high star-formation rates. We find that the velocity dispersion is most fundamentally correlated with their star-formation rates, and not their mass nor gas fraction, which leads to a new picture where star formation itself is the energetic driver of galaxy disk turbulence at all cosmic epochs.</summary>

            <summary>While the fat tailed jump size and the waiting time distributions characterizing individual human trajectories strongly suggest the relevance of the continuous time random walk (CTRW) models of human mobility, no one seriously believes that human traces are truly random. Given the importance of human mobility, from epidemic modeling to traffic prediction and urban planning, we need quantitative models that can account for the statistical characteristics of individual human trajectories. Here we use empirical data on human mobility, captured by mobile phone traces, to show that the predictions of the CTRW models are in systematic conflict with the empirical results. We introduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a statistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility. The model not only accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws but also allows us to analytically predict most of the pertinent scaling exponents.</summary>

            <summary>Many-body interactions in transition-metal oxides give rise to a wide range of functional properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, or multiferroicity. The seminal recent discovery of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of the insulating oxides LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 represents an important milestone towards exploiting such properties in all-oxide devices. This conducting interface shows a number of appealing properties, including a high electron mobility, superconductivity, and large magnetoresistance and can be patterned on the few-nanometer length scale. However, the microscopic origin of the interface 2DEG is poorly understood. Here, we show that a similar 2DEG, with an electron density as large as 8x10^13 cm^-2, can be formed at the bare SrTiO3 surface. Furthermore, we find that the 2DEG density can be controlled through exposure of the surface to intense ultraviolet (UV) light. Subsequent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal an unusual coexistence of a light quasiparticle mass and signatures of strong many-body interactions.</summary>

            <summary>Quantum electrodynamics describes the interactions of electrons and photons. Electric charge (the gauge coupling constant) is energy dependent, and there is a previous claim that charge is affected by gravity (described by general relativity) with the implication that the charge is reduced at high energies. But that claim has been very controversial with the situation inconclusive. Here I report an analysis (free from earlier controversies) demonstrating that that quantum gravity corrections to quantum electrodynamics have a quadratic energy dependence that result in the reduction of the electric charge at high energies, a result known as asymptotic freedom.</summary>

            <summary>The results of local measurements on some composite quantum systems cannot be reproduced classically. This impossibility, known as quantum nonlocality, represents a milestone in the foundations of quantum theory. Quantum nonlocality is also a valuable resource for information processing tasks, e.g. quantum communication, quantum key distribution, quantum state estimation, or randomness extraction. Still, deciding if a quantum state is nonlocal remains a challenging problem. Here we introduce a novel approach to this question: we study the nonlocal properties of quantum states when distributed and measured in networks. Using our framework, we show how any one-way entanglement distillable state leads to nonlocal correlations. Then, we prove that nonlocality is a non-additive resource, which can be activated. There exist states, local at the single-copy level, that become nonlocal when taking several copies of it. Our results imply that the nonlocality of quantum states strongly depends on the measurement context.</summary>
