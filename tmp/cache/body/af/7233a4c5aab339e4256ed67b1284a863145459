We identify another distinct process, reuse for customization. Reuse for customization is a process in which designers manipulate the parameters of metamodels to produce models that fulfill their personal needs. We test hypotheses about reuse for customization in Thingiverse, a community of designers that shares files for three-dimensional printing. 3D metamodels are reused more often than the 3D models they generate. The reuse of metamodels is amplified when the metamodels are created by designers with greater community experience. Metamodels make the community's design knowledge available for reuse for customization-or further extension of the metamodels, a kind of reuse for innovation.","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08072v1","published_at":"2017-02-26T19:16:06+08:00","authors":"","concepts":["reuse","metamodels","customization","designers","knowledge","distinct","innovation","community","3d","theories"],"embedding_2d":{"x":-0.257199,"y":-0.322113},"similarity_score":null},{"origin_id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04515v1","title":"Research Curation on Knowledge Management","abstract":"The notions of knowledge and its management have been at the core of the information systems (IS) field almost since its inception. Knowledge has been viewed in several ways in the prior literature, including as a state of mind, an object, a process, access to information, and a capability. A commonly-used definition characterizes knowledge as a justified belief that increases an entity's capacity for effective action (Alavi and Leidner 2001, p. 109). Relatedly, knowledge management (KM) has been defined as a systemic process to acquire, organize, and communicate individual knowledge so that others may make use of it (Beck et al. 2014). Knowledge-management systems (KMSs) support these processes for creating, exchanging, and storing knowledge (Beck et al. 2014), and have been viewed as being either repository- based or network-based (Kankanhalli et al. 2005). In an attempt to provide a useful resource for scholars interested in KM, we take stock of the pertinent research published in MISQ. More specifically, the goal of this curation is to serve as a living document that will offer a starting point for future KM research. This curation highlights the 44 articles with a primary focus on KM (Table 1). The articles address theoretical and conceptual issues, provide methodological guidance, and use a wide range of quantitative and qualitative research methods. To define the scope of this curation, we excluded: (1) articles in which KM is used as part of another construct; (2) some early articles that were practice- oriented with limited scholarly orientation; and (3) articles that focus on knowledge (such as the knowledge requirements of IS professionals) but not on KM.","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04515v1","published_at":"2018-05-11T10:31:48+08:00","authors":"","concepts":["knowledge","km","articles","research","curation","management","information","systems","viewed","process"],"embedding_2d":{"x":-0.38004,"y":-0.150331},"similarity_score":null},{"origin_id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00663v1","title":"Synthetic Knowing: The Politics of the Internet of Things","abstract":"All knowing is material. The challenge for Information Systems (IS) research is to specify how knowing is material by drawing on theoretical characterizations of the digital. Synthetic knowing is knowing informed by theorizing digital materiality. We focus on two defining qualities: liquefaction (unhinging digital representations from physical objects, qualities, or processes) and open-endedness (extendable and generative). The Internet of Things (IoT) is crucial because sensors are vehicles of liquefaction. Their expanding scope for real-time seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and touching increasingly mimics phenomenologically perceived reality. Empirically, we present a longitudinal case study of IoT-rendered marine environmental monitoring by an oil and gas company operating in the politically contested Arctic. We characterize synthetic knowing into four concepts, the former three tied to liquefaction and the latter to open-endedness: (i) the objects of knowing are algorithmic phenomena; (ii) the sensors increasingly conjure up phenomenological reality; (iii) knowing is scoped (configurable); and (iv) open knowing/data is politically charged.","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00663v1","published_at":"2019-03-02T09:30:23+08:00","authors":"","concepts":["digital","liquefaction","qualities","objects","openendedness","sensors","increasingly","reality","politically","synthetic knowing"],"embedding_2d":{"x":-0.20857,"y":-0.626205},"similarity_score":null},{"origin_id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10468v1","title":"Heterogeneous Demand Effects of Recommendation Strategies in a Mobile Application: Evidence from Econometric Models and Machine-Learning Instruments","abstract":"In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of various recommendation strategies in the mobile channel and their impact on consumers' utility and demand levels for individual products. We find significant differences in effectiveness among various recommendation strategies. Interestingly, recommendation strategies that directly embed social proofs for the recommended alternatives outperform other recommendations. Besides, recommendation strategies combining social proofs with higher levels of induced awareness due to the prescribed temporal diversity have an even stronger effect on the mobile channel. In addition, we examine the heterogeneity of the demand effect across items, users, and contextual settings, further verifying empirically the aforementioned information and persuasion mechanisms and generating rich insights. We also facilitate the estimation of causal effects in the presence of endogeneity using machine-learning methods. Specifically, we develop novel econometric instruments that capture product differentiation (isolation) based on deep-learning models of user-generated reviews. Our empirical findings extend the current knowledge regarding the heterogeneous impact of recommender systems, reconcile contradictory prior results in the related literature, and have significant business implications.","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10468v1","published_at":"2021-02-20T22:58:54+08:00","authors":"","concepts":["examine","effectiveness","impact","demand","levels","significant","mobile channel","social proofs","various recommendation strategies","paper"],"embedding_2d":{"x":-0.443684,"y":0.319793},"similarity_score":null},{"origin_id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18743v1","title":"From Representation to Mediation: A New Agenda for Conceptual Modeling Research in A Digital World","abstract":"The role of information systems (IS) as representations of real-world systems is changing in an increasingly digitalized world, suggesting that conceptual modeling is losing its relevance to the IS field. We argue the opposite: Conceptual modeling research is more relevant to the IS field than ever, but it requires an update with current theory. We develop a new theoretical framework of conceptual modeling that delivers a fundamental shift in the assumptions that govern research in this area. This move can make traditional knowledge about conceptual modeling consistent with the emerging requirements of a digital world. Our framework draws attention to the role of conceptual modeling scripts as mediators between physical and digital realities. We identify new research questions about grammars, methods, scripts, agents, and contexts that are situated in intertwined physical and digital realities. We discuss several implications for conceptual modeling scholarship that relate to the necessity of developing new methods and grammars for conceptual modeling, broadening the methodological array of conceptual modeling scholarship, and considering new dependent variables.","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18743v1","published_at":"2025-05-19T18:19:23+08:00","authors":"","concepts":["new","research","role","systems","field","framework","scripts","physical","grammars","methods"],"embedding_2d":{"x":-0.103936,"y":-0.241205},"similarity_score":null},{"origin_id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5815v2","title":"SAPFOCS: a metaheuristic based approach to part family formation problems in group technology","abstract":"This article deals with Part family formation problem which is believed to be moderately complicated to be solved in polynomial time in the vicinity of Group Technology (GT). In the past literature researchers investigated that the part family formation techniques are principally based on production flow analysis (PFA) which usually considers operational requirements, sequences and time. Part Coding Analysis (PCA) is merely considered in GT which is believed to be the proficient method to identify the part families. PCA classifies parts by allotting them to different families based on their resemblances in: (1) design characteristics such as shape and size, and/or (2) manufacturing characteristics (machining requirements). A novel approach based on simulated annealing namely SAPFOCS is adopted in this study to develop effective part families exploiting the PCA technique. Thereafter Taguchi's orthogonal design method is employed to solve the critical issues on the subject of parameters selection for the proposed metaheuristic algorithm. The adopted technique is therefore tested on 5 different datasets of size 5 {\\times} 9 to 27 {\\times} 9 and the obtained results are compared with C-Linkage clustering technique. The experimental results reported that the proposed metaheuristic algorithm is extremely effective in terms of the quality of the solution obtained and has outperformed C-Linkage algorithm in most instances.","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.5815v2","published_at":"2010-12-28T18:57:04+08:00","authors":"","concepts":["based","pca","technique","algorithm","believed","gt","analysis","requirements","method","different"],"embedding_2d":{"x":-0.163218,"y":0.177715},"similarity_score":null},{"origin_id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3594v1","title":"Portfolio selection problems in practice: a comparison between linear and quadratic optimization models","abstract":"Several portfolio selection models take into account practical limitations on the number of assets to include and on their weights in the portfolio. We present here a study of the Limited Asset Markowitz (LAM), of the Limited Asset Mean Absolute Deviation (LAMAD) and of the Limited Asset Conditional Value-at-Risk (LACVaR) models, where the assets are limited with the introduction of quantity and cardinality constraints. We propose a completely new approach for solving the LAM model, based on reformulation as a Standard Quadratic Program and on some recent theoretical results. With this approach we obtain optimal solutions both for some well-known financial data sets used by several other authors, and for some unsolved large size portfolio problems. We also test our method on five new data sets involving real-world capital market indices from major stock markets. Our computational experience shows that, rather unexpectedly, it is easier to solve the quadratic LAM model with our algorithm, than to solve the linear LACVaR and LAMAD models with CPLEX, one of the best commercial codes for mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems. Finally, on the new data sets we have also compared, using out-of-sample analysis, the performance of the portfolios obtained by the Limited Asset models with the performance provided by the unconstrained models and with that of the official capital market indices.","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.3594v1","published_at":"2011-05-18T11:32:51+08:00","authors":"","concepts":["models","limited asset","portfolio","several","assets","lamad","lacvar","approach","quadratic","problems"],"embedding_2d":{"x":0.150429,"y":0.279692},"similarity_score":null},{"origin_id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6237v1","title":"Quantum Game Theory","abstract":"Quantum game theory is the study of strategic behavior by agents with access to quantum technology.

The present work is the first identifiable academic literature review of the application of neural network based techniques to segmentation. Our study has provided an academic database of literature between the periods of 2000-2010 and proposed a classification scheme for the articles. One thousands (1000) articles have been identified, and around 100 relevant selected articles have been subsequently reviewed and classified based on the major focus of each paper. Findings of this study indicated that the research area of ANN based applications are receiving most research attention and self organizing map based applications are second in position to be used in segmentation. The commonly used models for market segmentation are data mining, intelligent system etc. Our analysis furnishes a roadmap to guide future research and aid knowledge accretion and establishment pertaining to the application of ANN based techniques in market segmentation. Thus the present work will significantly contribute to both the industry and academic research in business and marketing as a sustainable valuable knowledge source of market segmentation with the future trend of ANN application in segmentation.","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.2445v1","published_at":"2012-02-11T14:08:15+08:00","authors":"","concepts":["research","market segmentation","academic","articles","classification","system","study","applications","used","knowledge"],"embedding_2d":{"x":-0.417107,"y":0.326587},"similarity_score":null},{"origin_id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5942v5","title":"A unified modeling approach for the static-dynamic uncertainty strategy in stochastic lot-sizing","abstract":"In this paper, we develop mixed integer linear programming models to compute near-optimal policy parameters for the non-stationary stochastic lot sizing problem under Bookbinder and Tan's static-dynamic uncertainty strategy. Our models build on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds of the first order loss function. We discuss different formulations of the stochastic lot sizing problem, in which the quality of service is captured by means of backorder penalty costs, non-stockout probability, or fill rate constraints. These models can be easily adapted to operate in settings in which unmet demand is backordered or lost. The proposed approach has a number of advantages with respect to existing methods in the literature: it enables seamless modelling of different variants of the above problem, which have been previously tackled via ad-hoc solution methods; and it produces an accurate estimation of the expected total cost, expressed in terms of upper and lower bounds. Our computational study demonstrates the effectiveness and flexibility of our models.","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.5942v5","published_at":"2013-07-23T04:01:30+08:00","authors":"","concepts":["models","linear","upper","different","methods","lower bounds","stochastic lot sizing","lot sizing problem","paper","develop"],"embedding_2d":{"x":-0.021926,"y":0.376947},"similarity_score":null}]},"pagination":{"current":1,"total_pages":2,"total_count":15,"prev_page":null,"next_page":2}}}
